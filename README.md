Portfolio website created using React.
Contains information on my past internship experience, projects I have worked on, and some amateur photography.

Some react components used from [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) and some from [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

Some CSS help from [Tim Baker Development](https://github.com/tbakerx).
